# Linking_Notes_Project
In the following project we have decided to apply Name Entity recognition and Name Entity linking to teaching notes. 
In order to do this we have used our notes , we have created the labels divided for subject and we have tried to retrain spacy with 
this labels. 
We have also applied NEL to the entities found in order to gave the possibility to go into details for the concept of interest.
